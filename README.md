# Air Mouse
This project consists of a solution for controlling the mouse through hand gesture detection. It allows you to use gestures to perform commands on the computer.

## Features
- Cursor movement: By placing your index finger inside the highlighted rectangle in the camera area, the mouse will track the movements of your index finger and move the cursor on the screen.
- Click: If your index finger is inside the highlighted rectangle and you raise your pinky finger, the mouse will perform a click.
- Shortcut for minimizing windows: Make a fist gesture in the shortcut area to execute the "Win + D" shortcut and minimize all open windows.
- Shortcut for restoring windows: Open your fist in the shortcut area to execute the command again and restore the minimized windows.
